Let's start with this graph for Qatar, which tops the list of countries ordered by <b>Total cases per million</b> population.

![Figure 1](/img/img002.png)

It shows that in Qatar this indicator rose fast in May-June 2020 and then it slowed down to a plateau. So, Qatar should be in pretty bad shape by now (Sep 2020) one would think, right? Not really. Let's have a look at <b>Active cases per million</b>.

![Figure 2](/img/img004.png)

Notice how this indicator dropped dramatically after peaking out at the beginning of June. Let me rewrite this: after reaching around 12000 active cases/million on 2020-05-27, this indicator dropped tenfold by mid July and remained stable since then. How is this possible? Let's have look at the <b>Positive rate</b>.

![Figure 3](/img/img003.png)

It shows that Qatar successfully controlled the transmission of the disease beginning in July. <b>Active cases per million</b> dropped almost in sync with the <b>Positive rate</b>.

Let's see what the situation was at that time in a few other countries: Unites States, France, Spain, Netherlands, Sweden, and Israel. I chose these countries because they too are near the top on the <b>Active cases per million</b> list, as can be seen on the heat map.

<b>Active cases per million</b> were almost flat in June-July in Israel, Spain, France, and Netherlands while they were increasing fast in Qatar, Sweden, and the United States.

With the exception of Qatar, Sweden and the United States appear to have the highest <b>Positive rate</b> numbers in June-July (some the data for Sweeden is unavailable).

Notice how numbers blow up again in early September in Spain, France, and Israel; the United States and Netherlands seem to have more control over the situation while Sweden and Qatar clearly are in the best positions.

These plots also suggest that, an almost flat <b>Active cases per million</b> curve is consistent with a <b>Positive rate</b> of 1%-2%. At a rate of 4% and above it seems almost impossible to stop the daily increase in active cases. 

Central and South America during this time tell us a very different story... More on this later.

![Figure 7](/img/img006.png)

Let's see how The Five Eyes did. One country leads the pack, and at a first glance it would seem that <b>Positive rate</b> can explain the big differences.

![Figure 9](/img/img015.png)

However, if we overlay <b>Positive rate</b> and <i><b>New cases per million</b></i> (not presented in COV2CON), we notice the latter increased faster than the former in June-July. This is likely due to the high number of tests conducted in that country at that time, as published in the [media](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1111601/covid-19-tests-carried-out-daily-in-the-us/).
