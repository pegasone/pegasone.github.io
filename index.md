Let's start with this graph for Qatar, the country at the top of the list of countries ordered by <b>Total cases per million</b> population.

![Figure 1](/img/img002.png)

It shows that in Qatar this indicator rose fast in May-June 2020 and then it slowed down aiming towards a plateau. So, Qatar should be in pretty bad shape by now (Sep 2020) one would think, isn't it? Not really. Let's have a look at <b>Active cases per million</b>.

![Figure 2](/img/img004.png)

Notice how this indicator dropped dramatically after peaking out at the beginning of June. Let me rewrite this: after reaching 12000 active cases/million on 2020-05-27, the value of the indicator dropped tenfold by mid July and remained stable. How was this possible? Let's have look at the <b>Positive rate</b>.

It shows that Qatar successfully controlled the transmission of the disease beginning in July. <b>Active cases per million</b> dropped almost in sync with the <b>Positive rate</b>.

Let's see what the situation was at the same time in a few other countries: Unites States, France, Spain, Netherlands, Sweden, and Israel. I chose these countries because they too are near the top on the <b>Active cases per million</b> list, as can be seen on the heat map.

We can notice that <b>Active cases per million</b> were almost flat in June-July in Israel, Spain, France, and Netherlands but they were increasing fast in Sweden and the United States.

With exception of Qatar, Sweden and the United States appear to have had the highest <b>Positive rate</b> in June-July (some the data for Sweeden is unavaiable).

These plots also indicate that, an almost flat <b>Active cases per million</b> curve is consistent with a <b>Positive rate</b> of 1%-2%.

South America during this time was a totally different story...
