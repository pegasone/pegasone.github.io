Let's start with this graph for Qatar, the country at the top of the list of countries ordered by <b>Total cases per million</b> population.

It shows that in Qatar this indicator rose fast in May-June 2020 and then it slowed down aiming towards a plateau. So, Qatar should be in pretty bad shape by now (Sep 2020) one would think, isn't it? Not really. Let's have a look at <b>Active cases per million</b>.

Notice how this indicator dropped dramatically after peaking out at the beginning of June. Let me rewrite this: after reaching 12000 active cases/million on 2020-05-27, the value of the indicator dropped tenfold by mid July and remained stable. How was this possible? Let's have look at the <b>Positive rate</b>.

It shows that Qatar successfully controlled the transmission of the disease in its population. Active cases per million dropped almost in sync with the positive rate.

Let's see what was going on at the same time in a few other countries.

I chose these countries because they too are neat the top in the hierechy for , as can be seen from the heat map.

How does this compute with the Positive rate?
